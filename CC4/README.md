# Overview
This is a coding challenge completed for data stuctures and algorithms


## Name
Bram Kineman
## Feedback
This one was relatively easy. My largest issue ended up being the use of self
and how that works when self contains more than one data structure. For example,
when self has two lists, when calling self.is_empty(), which list is it checking?
Beyond that, this just took me longer than it needed to because of that previously 
mentioned issue as well as some logic flow issues (if blocks vs elif).
## Time to Completion
2 hours
## Citations
This is the Stack ADT from lecture. This helped me immensely with additional
helper methods that supported the shortest_book capability.

This gave me a general direction of where to go with this.
